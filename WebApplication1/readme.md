# About

This project shows how to work with [Bootstrap 5.3.4](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2025/04/03/bootstrap-5-3-4/) modals. 

In the home page the modal is created in the page while Index1 a [partial view](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/partial?view=aspnetcore-9.0) is used, `Shared\_ConfirmationModal.cshtml`.

If new to working with Bootstrap modals review the documentation as for instance a standard example found on the web does not center or force a user to respond as done with the examples in this project.

Note that the name of the project was done as it was supposed to be a throwaway project and not a throwaway now.

## Bootstrap 5.3.4

At least at time of writing this, the latest version of Bootstrap is `5.3.4` was not available via libman so it was installed using `npm i bootstrap@v5.3.4`
